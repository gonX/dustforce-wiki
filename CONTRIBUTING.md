# Content Guidelines

## Images
**Keep usage of images in content to a minimum.**

Their use should be educational, and should preferably only be used where text would otherwise be insufficient to get the point across.

### Formats
Lossless:
- PNG
- SVG

Lossy:
- JPG (reasonable qualities please!)

### Dimensions
As small as possible while still retaining important detail
