msg555 reports this on the Daily algorithm:

> The pool of levels is all maps (visible or not) on Atlas that are not part of the CMP and have not been the daily before. It picks 5 maps uniformly at random from that set and chooses the one that has the most SSes. There's nothing preventing a map with 0 SSes from being chosen.
