Dustmod is a drop-in replacement mod designed to enhance the original Dustforce experience, both in terms of performance, usability, as well as visuals.

A significant amount of newer custom maps use elements that are only available in Dustmod.

Some features include:
- Extended configuration options
- Extended leaderboard filtering
- Daily featured custom level
- Online multiplayer (2-4 players)
- Additional community nexuses (maps technically individually available on atlas without Dustmod)
- Replay ghosts
- Plugin framework
- Save file management
- Extended DirectX 12 and OpenGL support (Vanilla is DX9)
- TAS tools

Dustmod is closed source software created and maintained by msg555 with the original Dustforce DX source code provided pro bono by Hitbox Team.
