name: Point values on Atlas
---

On the official custom map hub, Atlas, the point system (which dictate your displayed "rank" on your Atlas profile page) are as follows:

- Making an account: 100
- Voting on a map: 10
- Commenting on a map: 40 (labelled as "answers". Only includes top-level comments, not replies)
- Replying to a comment: 0

- Making a map: 300 (labelled as "questions". Does not include hidden maps)
- Receiving an "upvote": 30 (3-5 hearts)
- Receiving a "downvote": -10 (1-2 hearts)

(note, it seems possible to have received votes without having any maps. may be votes on hidden maps?)
