Welcome to dustforce.info!

This site was originally designed as a replacement for the tech pastebin, but aims to centralize the collective Dustforce knowledge in a single spot!

The site is currently in development and can be contributed to on Github: [gonX/dustforce-wiki](https://github.com/gonX/dustforce-wiki)

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we're at the point where _any_ content is better than no content - however please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/gonX/dustforce-wiki/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request. Contributing unfortunately requires a Github account.

If you aren't already, using [Dustmod](#dustmod) is highly recommended!

As this is more of an information center rather than a guide to the game, we highly suggest that you read czyys' Dustforce guide which is linked in the list below.
