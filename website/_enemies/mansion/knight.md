Has a shield that blocks incoming attacks from the front when it is grounded. Attacking this shield does not give hitrise, but instead stalls the players vertical momentum. It also rewards double the combo progress of most attacks (2 combo per light, 6 combo per heavy).

When they see an enemy, they will try to move into a position a swords length away before attacking. This can be used to lure them away from their path as seen on [this Ramparts replay](http://dustkid.com/replay/-11188083).
