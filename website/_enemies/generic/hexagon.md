This enemy can only be destroyed by hitting it with a heavy attack.

Light attacks will reward 2 combo, but will not deal any damage, and will not grant any [Hitrise](#hitrise). However, light attacks will stall the players vertical momentum, allowing them to hover while attacking repeatedly.

Supering this entity will reward only 1 combo.

Commonly referred to as a Heavy Prism.
