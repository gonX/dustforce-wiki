While this enemy traditionally has 5 health, you can "snap the stem" by attacking away from the surface it is on, then in a perpendicular direction of the stretch in quick succession. This means it effectively only has 2 HP if you can use this technique properly. If not killed during the stretch, the blob will snap back and create a large hitbox.

During the recoil animation, they have some invulnerability frames where the player may attack them to build combo without dealing damage. This can be abused in maps such as [Slime Invulnerability](http://atlas.dustforce.com/7105/slime-invulnerability).

Commonly referred to as a Spring Blob, or a Rooted Slime Blob.
