While this enemy traditionally has 5 health, you can "snap the stem" by attacking the perpendicular direction of the stretch in quick succession. This means it effectively only has 2 HP if you can use this property properly.

However, watch out, because if not killed during the stretch, the blob will snap back, potentially inflicting damage on the player.
