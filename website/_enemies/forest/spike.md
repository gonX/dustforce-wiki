Can be hit and redirected by entities on the opposing "team" to the previous owner. The entity that hits it becomes the new owner. Once redirected by the player with an attack, it can hit other enemies for 100 (!) damage, as demonstrated in top [Wild Den](#maps-level-wild-den) replays.

This can also be used for quill passing as seen in [Redirection](http://atlas.dustforce.com/9134/redirection)

Commonly referred to as a Quill.
