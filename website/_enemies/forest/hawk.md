A mostly complete entity present in the game files that was not used in the completed game.

Despite not being able to place it from the level editor in vanilla Dustforce, Dustmod will list it.

When it initiates an attack, the hawk will be attracted towards your mouse cursor. This may cause desyncs if you are not using Dustmod, as the standard replay format does not record mouse position.
