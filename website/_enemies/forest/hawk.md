A mostly complete entity present in the game files that was not used in the completed game. Can be exposed in the level editor through Dustmod.

When it initiates an attack, the hawk will be attracted towards your mouse cursor. This may cause desyncs if you are not using Dustmod, as the standard replay format does not record mouse position.
