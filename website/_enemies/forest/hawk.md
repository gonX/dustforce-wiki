A mostly complete entity present in the game files that was not used in the completed game. Can be exposed in the level editor through [Dustmod](http://dustmod.com/).

When it initiates an attack, the hawk will be attracted towards your mouse cursor. This can cause desyncs, as the standard replay format does not record mouse position.
