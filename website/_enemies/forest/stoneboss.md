Attacks by falling on the enemy. Has an active hitbox as long as it is falling during its attack, which allows the player to farm super quickly as demonstrated in top [Overgrown Temple](#maps-level-overgrown-temple) Any% replays.

Can be lured outside of its path.

Commonly referred to as a Large Totem.
