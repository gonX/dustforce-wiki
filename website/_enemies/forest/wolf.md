Its attack is performed by "lunging" at the player. Hitting them interrupts their attack.

When out of range to lunge, they will accelerate to a very high top speed until close enough to attack. If they are in mid-air at this point, they can still lunge while falling.

Commonly referred to as Fox or Wolf interchangeably.
