name: Ledge Climb

When wallrunning, if you reach the top of the wall you will climb over the ledge and enter a special hover state.

Your Y value is modified through a special separate variable so that you are still able to downdash and dashjump while moving upwards, which is normally not possible.

Ledgeclimbs are nearly always cancelled via [Mantling](#mantles) or [Ledge Cancelling](#ledge-cancels).

They are rarely useful to gain a small amount of additional height for an attack or before Aerial Dashjumping.
