Walls and ceilings in this game have a “sticky” property where coming in contact with them makes it a little difficult to move away from them until the character grabs then releases the surface.

In some situations this can be problematic, but it can be used to gain speed in certain situations.

When your character gets stuck to a wall but hasn’t actually grabbed it, they remain in the appropriate airborne state (jump, raise, hover or fall) and are affected by gravity as normal, but their left/right motion is forced to remain in line with the wall in question.

For overhanging slanted walls, this can actually give the player great horizontal speed as the character falls as per normal, but is pulled along sideways by the stickiness of the wall above them.

For somewhat arcane reasons, this maneuver is known as a Droof.

It is not possible to droof on leftward slants.

#### Magnet Hijack Boost

At the exact moment that a ceiling changes angle, your character’s speed will be angled to line up with the new angle of a ceiling.

If simultaneous to this your character does something that makes their movement not line up with the angle of the ceiling, this will be overridden.

In particular, if your character downdashes, giving them significant downward velocity, precisely at a corner on a ceiling, their new speed including the velocity of the downdash will be calculated then angled to line up with the ceiling.

This gives a significant speed boost, often at an upward angle, without requiring use of an aircharge.

Taking advantage of MHBs requires fairly specific ceiling geometry, but when possible it can quickly generate high speeds in situations where that would otherwise be impossible without the use of an aircharge.

The same magnetic sticky phenomenon used for MHB’s is also how Zetta Slopes work.
