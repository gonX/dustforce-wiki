name: Ledge Clips

The corners of ledges are not completely solid, and can be clipped into and used to push yourself upwards or downwards slightly by doing so.

These are abused in various ways: to gain a small amount of extra height, to airjump/dash slightly earlier than should be possible when falling past a ceiling, to get extra falling speed or better align certain boosts, etc.

Ledgeclipping is sometimes important to avoid or delay, however, since when ledgeclipping up to a higher ledge than you technically should be able to reach, you retain your velocity when the ledgeclip bumps you upward, which can actually delay the time you can land on that ledge as you get stuck in hover.
