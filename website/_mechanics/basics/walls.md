#### Wall Grab
Grabbing a Wall can actually be used to cancel several different states, most notably dashes and attack recovery.

Walls can be used to cancel heavy attack recovery or perform a followup attack in a normally disallowed direction (seen on Dahlia and Archive), cancel aerial dashes to immediately let you downdash (seen on Titan), and cancel hitrise out of attacks that hit enemies (seen on Exa Difficult and Yotta Difficult).

Wall Grab itself may be canceled immediately by simply pressing away from the wall.

When you do so, if you have downward Y velocity and are not holding down, your Y velocity is set to 0. If you have upward Y velocity or are holding down, you keep your current Y velocity.
 
#### Wall Run
Initiated by pressing up during a wall grab, wall runs immediately set your speed to 522 in the direction of the wall if it is less.

During the first 21 frames speed decays linearly, after which it begins a significantly faster logarithmic decay.

Unlike Wall Grab, Wall Run cannot be canceled by pressing away from the wall, only by walljumping, walldashing, or reaching the ledge or ceiling at the top of the wall.
 
#### Wall Slide
When touching towards a wall, you can slide down it, most frequently done via “Wall Tapping” the wall while falling, or simply by sliding down a long slanted wall such as in the ending of Archive.

Speed of the wall slide will vary based on character, directional inputs, and the angle of the wall.
 
#### Wall Jump
Has 5 frames of startup before jumping off of the wall, these can be edge cancelled however, which is usually done at the top of a wall as we are wallrunning up it, and very occasionally at the bottom of a wall as we fall past it.

These give you the same height of a regular grounded or aerial jump, but usually give you only 348 horizontal speed and radically limit your air control until the peak of your jump.

When jumping off an overhanging slanted wall, however, you receive significantly more horizontal speed, actually slightly over dash speed..

If the player is close enough to a wall when inputting a jump in midair, they will be immediately pulled over to the wall and start a walljump instead of an airjump.

This can be used to save some time by walljumping before actually reaching the wall, but can also be fatal if the nearby wall has spikes on it.

When performing an “early” walljump like this, if the player has upward velocity in the air and is holding up and toward the wall, the player will actually get some slight upward speed during the beginning of the walljump startup, as they would if they started a wallrun immediately before walljumping.

Walljumps have no startup when performed from “wall grab idle” state, but reaching that state requires hanging on a wall for so long this is almost never useful.

If you're jumping off a left-facing slant wall you may be able to walljump "infinitely". See [Infinite Walljump](#infinite-walljump)
 
#### Wall Dash
Has 5 frames of startup before releasing from the wall, these can be edge cancelled however, though it is rare to be able to do so.

If you also have an air charge to use, you can wall dash and then airjump to jump with significantly higher speed than most walljumps would grant you, at the cost of an aircharge of course.

However, during the very beginning of this dash, you’re still close enough to the wall to be able to walljump off of it, cancelling your dash and returning you to the wall.

As with a walljump, walldashes can be performed when only near a wall, but unlike a walljump, walldashes cannot be performed while holding toward the wall, only with a neutral or away horizontal direction input.

As with walljumps, walldashes have no startup from “wall grab idle” state, but this basically never useful.
