#### Surface Boosting

When a character hits a surface, they lose some portion of their speed based on their angle of incidence as shown below, and the rest of their speed is converted to line up parallel with the surface they’ve run into.

This is used most frequently to convert falling speed into ground speed (referred to as Groundboosting for flat ground and Slant- or Slopeboosting when taking advantage of advantageous ground angles), but also applies to collisions with walls and ceilings.

#### Corner/Ceiling Boost
Boosting on a slanted or sloped ceiling by walljumping at the point where the wall and ceiling meet is often referred to as a “Corner Boost” and is a reliable way to get a fast ceiling boost.

When jumping from a overhanging slanted wall, the extra horizontal speed makes for an even faster boost. This is known as an "Access boost" (named after the stock map, [Access](#maps-level-access)).

Even without an advantageous slope it’s possible to get a boost on a ceiling, but the fact that you need to be moving upward rather than downward means that these sorts of Ceilingboosts generally aren’t as significant as other boosts, as the amount of upward speed we can get is usually very limited.

#### Wall Boost
The most common kind of Wallboost is when transferring a ground speed boost into a wall with the help of a slope or a slanted wall.

However, when jumping into a wall, jump timing and the resultant angle you hit the wall at can have a dramatic effect on your upward speed after the collision. Occasionally, it’s even possible to get a downward Wallboost when trying to fall quickly.

#### Parallel Boost / Fitboost
Lastly, though most boosts center around converting a high amount of speed in one direction into less speed in a more useful direction (e.g. fall speed to sideways speed), it’s also possible to get a “boost” by aligning your movement as closely as possible with a surface.

For example, if jumping upward at a 45 degree angle toward a 45 degree upward slope, it’s possible to land with a near-0 degree angle of incidence, keeping almost all of your total speed.

Once the ground levels out, this converts to about a 40% increase in horizontal speed.

#### Clipboost

When Ground-, Slant- or Slopeboosting, it’s sometimes possible to fall slightly past the surface in question and gain extra falling speed, then [ledgeclip](#ledge-clips) up onto it for a better speed boost than you’d normally be able to get from your initial height.
