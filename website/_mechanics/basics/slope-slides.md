When the tile of ground beneath the player is 45 degrees, you can press down to begin a slope slide.

While in slope slide state, the character will asymptotically approach their slope slide speed (see stats for [M](#charstats-dustman)/[G](#charstats-dustgirl)/[K](#charstats-dustkid)/[W](#charstats-dustworth)), so slope slides allow the character to gain much more speed than simply dashing or running, and are better than running or skidding at preserving speed when going even faster than that.

Landing on a slope from a large fall allows the player to gain even higher speeds (see [Boosting](#boosting)) and once the slope ends at the bottom this speed can be fully transferred into horizontal speed.

You can begin slope sliding even while attacking.
