### (TYPE)boost
Gaining speed via impacting level geometry (groundboost, slopeboost, etc.) or abusing other mechanics (airdash boost/ADB, magnet hijack boost/MHB, etc.)

See [Boosting](#boosting)

{:.no_toc}
### Light, Heavy
The two strengths of attack available to each character.

See [Attacks](#attacks) in the Advanced section.

{:.no_toc}
### Super
The wide-area special attack usable only after the combo meter reaches 100.

See [Supers](#supers)

{:.no_toc}
### Empty Super
A fast super hitting no enemies, used to clean only surfaces and dustblocks.

See [Empty super](#empty-super) in the Supers card.

{:.no_toc}
### Seam attacks
Attacks can sometimes clean or spread dust via the “seam” between adjacent blocks.

See [Seam Attacks](#seam-attacks)

{:.no_toc}
### Time dilation
The way supers and attack startup slow the relative timescale for the player.

See [Time Dilation](#time-dilation) in the Attacks card.

{:.no_toc}
### Time manipulation
Taking advantage of how time dilation subtly changes movement.

See [Time Dilation](#time-dilation) in the Attacks card.

{:.no_toc}
### Land-cancel
Air downlights are automatically aborted shortly after landing on the ground.

This is briefly covered in the [Dash Rhythm](#dash-rhythm) section of the Dashes card.

{:.no_toc}
### Early exit
Menuing and selecting “exit level” before the level finishes, but late enough that the level end triggers during the fadeout.

See [Early Exit](#early-exit)

{:.no_toc}
### Mouse exit
When exiting a level, clicking “yes” rather than navigating with the keyboard or controller sends the player directly back to the Main Nexus.

{:.no_toc}
### Cycle
Entity (ie. enemy) positions are calculated from when the entity was last loaded, which is indirectly influenced by the path (and time) taken through the level.

{:.no_toc}
### Aircharge
The counter tracking how many times a character can jump or dash in midair.

This is covered in the stats for the [characters](#playable-characters), but briefly put, all characters except Dustkid only has 1 air charge.

{:.no_toc}
### Air dashjump
A simultaneous dash and jump in the air with only one aircharge.

See [Aerial Dash Jumping](#aerial-dash-jumping)

{:.no_toc}
### Ledgeclip
The game nudges the player up/down when approaching a corner from the side

See [Ledge Clips](#ledge-clips)

{:.no_toc}
### Slopejump
An instant startup ground jump from slope slide state.

See [Slope and Spike Jumps](#slope-and-spike-jumps)

{:.no_toc}
### Spikejump
A safe jump off of 45 degree spikes.

See [Slope and Spike Jumps](#slope-and-spike-jumps)

{:.no_toc}
### Walltap
Grabbing a wall for one frame or less to clean dust or reset x speed while falling.

Related reading would be [Wall Grab](#wall-grab) in the Walls card.

{:.no_toc}
### Superdrop
Unrelated to actual Supers, this is the technique used for quickly cleaning dust (using light attacks) while falling at high speeds.

{:.no_toc}
### Left friction
An unintentional programming oversight causes air friction to be much more intense when travelling leftwards.

See [Air Friction](#air-friction)

{:.no_toc}
### Updash
Avoiding friction by delaying a wallrun after dashing from a slope up a wall.

See [Updashing](#updashing) in the Expert section.

{:.no_toc}
### Extended ceiling run/slide
The player can briefly remain in ceiling slide state mid-air after the ceiling ends.

See [Ceiling Grab](#ceiling-grab)

{:.no_toc}
### Air walljump
After grabbing and sliding off a wall, the player can still walljump in midair.

See [Air Walljump](#air-walljump)

{:.no_toc}
### Infinite walljump
Left friction allows for repeated jumps off left-facing overhanging walls.

See [Infinite Walljumo](#infinite-walljump)

{:.no_toc}
### Dyno
Walljumping and regrabbing the same wall by jumping at the point where it transfers from vertical to an overhanging slant.

{:.no_toc}
### Jorf
A small area near the edge of a spiked surface which can be touched safely.

See [Jorfs](#Jorfs)

{:.no_toc}
### Mapler Slide
A technique to extend ceiling runs to retain speed for longer and/or travel farther.

See [Mapler Slides](#mapler-slides)

{:.no_toc}
### Droof
A technique to gain great horizontal speed by falling next to a right-facing slanted wall.

See [Droofs](#droofs)

{:.no_toc}
### Taildash
A technique to rapidly turn around or gain a small amount of speed on a slope.

See [Itay Dash and Taildash](#itay-dash-and-taildash)

{:.no_toc}
### Slopesurfing
Technique used to dash on a slope but cancel the dash immediately.

See [Slopesurfing](#slopesurfing)

{:.no_toc}
### Raiserun
A tech that enters the wrong state when jumping, allowing an earlier wallrun.

See [Raiserunning](#raiserunning)

{:.no_toc}
### Clip
Certain configurations of geometry allow the player to pass through solid walls.

{:.no_toc}
### Magnet
Jumping or dashing mid-air will "magnet" you to walls up to 42 horizontal units away (almost a full tile).

This is often negatively experienced for the first time for many players in [Backup Shift](#maps-level-backup-shift) (TODO: earlier levels?)
However, it can also be used for positive effect as is often seen in the Walls (last) section of [Giga Difficult](#maps-level-giga-difficult).
{:.no_toc}
### Hitrise
When you damage (or kill) an enemy with an attack, your character rises ever so slightly.

This is often negatively experienced for the first time for many players in [Mega Difficult](#maps-level-mega-difficult).

See [Hitrise](#hitrise)
