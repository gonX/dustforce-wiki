In comparison to Dustman, generally has less advantageous hitboxes on her light attacks, but more useful heavy attacks.

Her heavy attack hitboxes are slightly wider than Dustman's, which is useful in several places. See [Attack Hitboxes](#attack-hitboxes).

Accelerates faster than Dustman when falling without downdashing.

This means she gets a bit less distance out of her jumps, but when levels start with the character falling, she reaches terminal velocity slightly sooner than Dustman, giving her a headstart of about 2 frames.

Is located second, rather than first, in the character select, which can save 2 frames switching to/from the characters further right in the list.

Since she and Dustman generally play very similarly, there are several levels where this is actually the deciding factor for character choice.

In comparison to Dustman, she has higher ground friction, so keeping speed with perfect [dash rhythm](#dash-rhythm) is more important. This is particularly seen in dash rhythm Atlas maps.
