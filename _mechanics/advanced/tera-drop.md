A 1 tile wide gap with spikes on both sides is known as a Tera gap.

These have a 3 unit gap that the character can fit within without dying.

Can be jumped up between, or fallen through (known as a Tera Jump or Tera Drop respectively)

A gap with spikes only on 1 side is known as a Half-Tera

This is occasionally used in the Nexus, Tera Difficult and Yotta Difficult (and others?)
