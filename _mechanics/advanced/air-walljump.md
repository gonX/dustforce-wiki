An interesting oversight in the code means that if you grab a wall with vertical speed, and then your vertical speed carries you off the top of the wall without wallrunning, you can store the ability to walljump in midair, with no wall nearby.

This stored ability to walljump only lasts while you remain in the “raise” state, so once your vertical speed hits 0, you can no longer walljump in midair. This is used only once in the entire run.
