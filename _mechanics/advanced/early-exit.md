If we finish the level during level exit fadeout, we still receive credit for completing the level.

This will be done on nearly every level in the game, as it both starts the fadeout as soon as possible (usually saving 18 frames per level) and skips the extremely slow score screen.

Early exits do place some restrictions on what actions can be done during fadeout and sometimes a slower IGT is gotten as a result of saving real time from allowing a sooner early exit.
