One reason for the extra horizontal speed when jumping off an overhanging slanted wall is to push the player further away from the wall to prevent them from repeatedly walljumping off the same wall.

However, with left-facing overhanging slant walls, left air friction rapidly reduces that speed below 522, so all characters other than dustkid will still be close enough to the wall to walljump again after the 5 frames during which you can’t jump or dash at the beginning of a jump.

This process can be repeated indefinitely as long as the slanted wall continues, though having to repeatedly undergo jump startup means it usually isn’t very fast.
