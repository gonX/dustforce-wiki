Normally, attacks on surface dust are blocked by impeding walls.

The direction of the attack matters for this check, so a downward attack can clean dust on the far side of a wall as long as the attack isn’t blocked by a ceiling above it, but a side attack won’t normally be able to clean dust on the far side of a wall.

However, under certain circumstances, it’s possible for the line-of-sight calculations performed to squeeze through the seams between adjacent tiles and clean some dust on the far side.

This only works when the relevant coordinates are negative (e.g. if Y coordinates are negative, there’s a slight gap between vertically adjacent tiles), but by lining up attacks this way it’s sometimes possible to reach dust much further away than would normally be possible, since a side heavy attack or a super will have much more horizontal reach than the up/down heavy which you would normally need to use to clean dust on the other side of a wall.

Also applies to Dust Spreading in rare cases, and cause dust to spread in an unreachable location through a wall.
