Whenever we climb over the top of a wall, we can avoid spending a lot of time floating above the ground by ledge canceling (downdash -> dash). This is one of the few uses for [Double Tap Dash](#double-tap-dash) as the operation (down -> down -> dash) is easier than (down+dash -> dash).

#### Mantles

A Mantle is another form for ledge canceling, but it requires an aircharge.

By dashing at ground height (within 4(?) frames of leaving wallclimb) we are on the ground down to 1(?) frame faster than a normal ledge cancel. However, there are often better uses for an aircharge prior to the wallclimb.
