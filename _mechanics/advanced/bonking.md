Also known as Ceiling Bonking and Head Bonking.

Hitting your head on a ceiling without clinging to the ceiling, is useful when the ceiling is close to your current height, as you can jump cancel and downdash sooner than a dash cancel would allow.

Ceiling boosts can be achieved without clinging to the ceiling, meaning in many circumstances itâ€™s best to just briefly bonk the ceiling to get a small ceiling boost rather than having to actually grab the ceiling.
