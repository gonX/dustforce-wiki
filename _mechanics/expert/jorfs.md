Named after the player who discovered it, there’s a small oversight with edges of spiked platforms which allows for 1 “pixel” of leniency where you can stand on the platform without the spikes killing you.

This “Jorf” pixel is extremely handy for quick platforming, as you essentially have another platform to utilize to jump, regain aircharges, or even get a boost (often called Jorfboosting).

This applies to ceilings, floors and walls, regardless if they are sloped or flat.  Slanted and sloped jorfs are especially noteworthy, as the window of leniency is significantly wider due to the angle of the ground and, with a downhill angle, can be particularly effective for generating boosts.

Due to a separate oversight, the lower left corner of your character does not detect spikes on walls at all, so there is a much larger window of safety near the top right of spiked walls.

Despite the difference in cause and size, these are still often mistakenly known as “Walljorfs,” with Jorfs on other corners of walls sometimes being referred to as “true walljorfs” or similar.

Because of their great size (a full tile, rather than only one pixel) they can much more easily be used to walljump or wallcancel, and they allow for a brief wallrun as well.
