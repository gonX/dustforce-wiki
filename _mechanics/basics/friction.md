#### Air Friction
Applies when X speed is over 522, adjusts your speed based on how far away your X speed is from POSITIVE 522.

This results in significantly stronger speed penalties when moving left (at negative values greater than 522).

#### Ground Friction
Does not have the same left vs right issue that air friction has (thankfully)

Still applies when speed is over 522
