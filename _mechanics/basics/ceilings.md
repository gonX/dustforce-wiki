#### Ceiling Grab
Also known as “Ceiling Cling” or “Neutral Ceiling Run”

The first 10 frames are frictionless, allowing full speed conservation, this is increased to 15 frames as normal Dustman as mentioned in [Dustman](#character-dustman)

Once friction has started to apply, releasing from the ceiling has a 10 frame delay, this occurs regardless of the ceiling tiles ending, so can be extended into midair, this is known as an “Air Extended Ceiling Slide”.

Notably this ceiling run friction is frequently a smaller penalty to your speed than leftward air friction or, if travelling at an upward angle, gravity, so it is still intentionally used and saves time occasionally.

#### Ceiling Run

Started by holding up and forward. You can only ceiling run in the direction you already have velocity, so e.g. holding up and left will leave you in Ceiling Grab state if you have no sideways velocity or X velocity toward the right.

Sets you to 522 (all characters’ run speed) if your speed is less, and is frictionless for the first 20 frames.

Same rules for releasing the ceiling apply as with Ceiling Grab state. Air Ceiling Slides can be performed after either state so long as friction was applying.

#### Maplers

An advanced technique to preserve speed is by combining the frictionless frames of a ceiling grab together with the frictionless frames of a ceiling run.

This is called a [Mapler slide](#mapler-slides)
