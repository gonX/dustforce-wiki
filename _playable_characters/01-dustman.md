Dustman and Dustgirl both have the highest terminal Velocity, so they are able to get faster slopeboosts than Dustkid or Dustworth.

Has slightly more favorable (a 0.7% difference) ground friction compared to Dustgirl.

Has the best [Mapler Slides](#mapler-slides), as his neutral ceiling run is frictionless for 15 frames, the rest of the characters only have 10.

This is only the case for “regular” Dustman, the virtual-Dustman does not have this benefit. This is due to an extra frame of animation for the ceiling run only in the files of regular dustman.
