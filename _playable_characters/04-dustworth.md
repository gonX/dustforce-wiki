Large attack hitboxes with a slow attack speed

Dash speed is not also Maximum Run speed like is the case for other characters, he must spend 11~ frames accelerating after a dash finishes to fully accelerate from a stop.

Most used character in the TAS, since his high jumps and large attacks are extremely useful.

Climbing is generally the slowest movement we have to do, and Dustworth climbs the fastest.
