Has 2 maximum air charges and restores both upon cleaning an enemy in midair, all other characters have only 1.

Due to a programming error, she only starts a level with 1 air charge if the start position is located in the air.
The extra aircharge can be used on additional dashes allowing her to lock her speed for longer than other characters over long aerial distances.

Smaller jump height, somewhat mitigated by having a triple jump as opposed to a double jump, but is still generally a weakness.

Smaller attack hitboxes, but extremely fast attack speed.

Least used character in the TAS, although TAS allows her niche strengths to be more strongly taken advantage of.
